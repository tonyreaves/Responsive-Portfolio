                <p>
                    After a decade in journalism, I left to pursue coding. I've been a reporter, a copy editor, a web editor and a social media manager. In late 2017, I realized building things was the most rewarding part of the job, and that learning to code was becoming less and less intimidating. So I made the jump.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I've already built several pages and apps. You can check them out on my portfolio page. I'm proficient in JavaScript, and projects in my portfolio include jQuery and APIs. I've used CSS, Bootstrap and Materialize in layouts.</p>
              <br>
              <p>As a journalist, I was dedicated to making information engaging and easy to understand. I'm bringing that same philosophy to my web development. </p>

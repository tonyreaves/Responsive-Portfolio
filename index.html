                <img class="me" src="Images/me.jpg"> Before I got into coding, I was a journalist. I started at my hometown newspaper as a copy editor and page
                designer, before I became a reporter in the Oxford Hills region of Maine, an area so rural most Mainers have
                never heard of it. Then I moved to a bigger Maine paper where I worked as a web editor, editing stories and
                packaging them for online readers with punchy headlines good ledes. During my 5+ years there, I worked on
                social media strategy, audience engagement, setting up blogs, editing Wordpress styles, writing and aggregating
                stories, and even running our programmatic advertising. Then, last December, needing a change, I left the
                job with no plan except to pack up our possessions and drive to Arizona. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="about">I'm a beginner at this. I'd done some CSS at my old job and some online classes, but this class has definitely
                humbled me. So I'm proud of every working line of code.

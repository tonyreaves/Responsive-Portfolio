                <p>
                    After a decade in journalism, I left to pursue coding. I've been a reporter, a copy editor, a web editor and a social media
                    manager. At some point, I realized building things was the most rewarding part of the job, and that learning
                    to code was becoming less and less intimidating. </p> <br>
                <p>I've already built several pages and apps. You can check them out on my portfolio page. I'm hoping to keep
                    building my skills at the same rate I have since I began coding bootcamp.
